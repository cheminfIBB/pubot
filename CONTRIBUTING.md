## Branch names

The branch names **must** be named after issues so they **must** contain the corresponding issue number. Every issue has also a label. Thus, the only accepted convention naming branches is label-of-issue#number-of-issue. The labels are 3-letters shortcuts. Upper letters should be used.

For instance: BUG#42 or UPD#66 or ENH#13
